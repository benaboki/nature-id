## Birds
## Introduction
Linked IOC World Bird List with inaturalist and CITES lists. Wherever possible the inaturalist taxonID is used.

# IOC World Bird List
The IOC World Bird List version 5.4 (Oct 24, 2015) was obtained in 2015 from https://www.worldbirdnames.org/new. The IOC World Bird List is undergoing consolidation and improved alignment of  global checklists of birds. Many revisions have taken place since 2015 so this list is already outdated. This project breaks down the list into 5 components (order, family, genus, species and subspecies) to facilitate the maintenance and use of the list using database systems.

## Species Status Codes from IOC World Bird List

- AL – Accepted Lumps for species that are deemed to be conspecific and are DELETED

- AS – Accepted Splits that we deem valid and ADD to Master List

- DEL – Deleted from Master List or from active consideration of Proposed Splits

- DIS – Changes or corrections of a species Range

- ENG – Changes or corrections of English names

- EXT–Extinct Taxon

- NEW – a newly described taxon as opposed to a revision of prior taxonomy, splits or lumps

- PHY – Change that reflects new information on the phylogenetic relationships of the taxon

- PL – Proposed Lumps for species that are likely to be treated as conspecific with another taxon and that may be DELETED

- PS – Proposed Splits for splits that are being reviewed

- TAX – Change of scientific name, including issues of nomenclature (priority, gender etc) and revisions of genera
